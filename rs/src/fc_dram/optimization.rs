//!  Optimize code from `compiler.rs`
//! - things to optimize for:
//!     - performance (nr of required mem-cycles): mostly reduce nr of RowClone-ops (rest is mostly predetermined by logic-graph due to 1:1 mapping of LogicalOps -> FCDRAM Primitives)
//!     - success rate (mostly by choosing right rows to optimize for distance to sense-amps), includes input replication
//!     - memory-footprint (reduce nr of subarrays used by program)
//!         - manually adapt safe-space to program requirements: unused safe-space rows could still be used ?!
//!         - [ ] Rematerialization ?
